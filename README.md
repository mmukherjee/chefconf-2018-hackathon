# Introduction
This project is to demonstrate Chef Automate V2 integration/interaction.
To demonstrate this - our setup has a Chef Server, a Chef Automate V2 server and two test boxes on AWS -one running Ubuntu and the other running Windows.
We will initiate a compliance check from the Chef Compliance Server on the two nodes. We would expect to see the Compliance report on the Chef Automate V2 portal.
